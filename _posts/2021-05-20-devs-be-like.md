You all know that stereotype about programmers, right? Especially Hollywood loves to keep that idea about Silicon Valley nerds alive and breathing. That we live and breathe to code, non-programmers have to constantly remind us to "speak English and not jargon", how we do nothing but code from morning till night, no matter if we are getting paid for it or not.

I'm sure people like that exist but I'm not sure I know any personally. 

## Education

I began my journey to be a developer in my mid-20s when I started studying computer science at a university. I had absolutely no experience with programming (well, I used to have a MySpace page and I updated the theme probably twice a week, so I had tinkered with css a lot). In the beginning of my university studies I was very nervous about fitting in and not being "outed as a hoax" because I thought everybody else knew how to code before coming to university. At least in Finland the stereotype about knowing how to code before going to a school to learn how to code sits very tight. I think very few of those students who I spent my first year with actually knew any coding. You wouldn't expect a person starting at a medical school to already know how to do surgery or to make diagnosis so why should computer science students know how to code?

The stereotype about self-learned coders can be motivating to some. And sure, there are much worse ways for a teenager to spend their time. But how many great developers has the industry missed, because someone didn't have the time or the means as a kid to learn programming? Not everybody has a good enough computer at home that allows them to learn and develop their skills. Or they might have a computer at home, but they need to share it with the rest of the family. Especially if the decision about one's future career has to be made around your teenage years, the current stereotypes about programmers surely do not encourage to seek the profession if you do not have had the opportunity to learn.

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with teaching kids some coding or being interested and learning stuff by yourself. However, people should also be taught that you can start learning programming at any age. Going to a school to learn computer science or information technology without any previous knowledge is totally fine. It's called a _school_ for a reason, right?

## Getting a job

Getting your first job as a programmer can either be easy as heck or the most stressful thing in your entire year. When I was in university, my friends who had time, energy, and interest to do serious hobby projects got job offers at job fairs just by showing what they can do. The rest of us were left feeling (at least I was) overwhelmed and a little scared. 

For a junior developer, having some hobby projects to show can be that crucial thing to land that first job. I never had anything special or grand in my Github. I had some css stuff and, if I recall correctly, a very sad skeleton of a project. I definitely could've invested more in those. But for me, they were there just to show possible employers, that I've done _something_. Since I joined Solita in 2017, excluding some university courses, I haven't done _any_ coding whatsoever that I wasn't paid to do. 

Now that I'm not a junior developer anymore and I'm not actively thinking about switching jobs, I have zero interest to work on any hobby project.

## Keeping your job

No job in the world is static and stays the same. And software development is definitely not a field to change slowly. Being a professional developer you need to keep up with the new stuff. But that's the great part about this job! There is so much to learn and so many ways to develop your own skills further. 

But that does not mean that you need to use your own free time to do all that learning. And obviously, if you want to make a more drastic move in your professional path, you might need to invest some of your own time to learn the basics of that new competence area. But I think that normal project work or time allocated by your company should provide you with enough chances to learn those new, hot and hip programming languages, frameworks, etc.

And besides, software development is definitely not all about coding. Communication is super important. Good people skills come in very handy when you're part of a team. At least someone in the project should have pretty solid skills in coordination and organization. Each team needs a variety of skills and not every developer needs to be the best in programming. They can be a solid 8+ (in Finland we are graded from 4 to 10, 10 being the best), but have good people skills. Or they can be a Jira-wizard and use some of their time organizing the team's backlog.

At least here in Solita, learning new things on company time is very strongly recommended. Feedback is collected from us regularly and one of the things asked is whether or not we are able to learn and to develop ourselves in our daily work life. For me, this is a message that I do not have to spend my evenings learning new things. I can do that during the day and get paid for it. And that leaves me with more time to do things I enjoy and things that energize me.

## Everything else

Sure, it is possible that your life consists mostly of programming. But in the long run, it might be healthier to have some kind of balance. I really enjoy programming, but it is not even close to the top-3 most important things in my life. It might make it to top-10, maybe.

Personally, variance in the things I do is super important. For a short while I might be able to focus on some free time programming tasks, but after a while, I know I'd just drop it and forget about it. 

Instead, I want to use my time with my spouse. I want to take time to go to the indoor climbing gym. I want to take time to see my friends. Having those things in my life and being able to do other things after work than just switching to a hobby project helps me keep balance in my life.

And because I do those things on my free time, I am a better programmer at work. I often notice that I've solved some code-related issue in the evening while taking a shower or cleaning the kitchen. I'm not actively thinking about my problem but my brain is still processing it on the background. [Tuuli Mutkala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuuli-mutkala-6a6b97a8/) spoke about this also in her blog post [Emotional Code](https://dev.solita.fi/2021/01/04/emotional-code.html).

If you have the energy and the time and you want to invest in a hobby project - go for it! But it's also totally fine to want to focus on your family, or kids, or some sports, or your friends. Do what helps you maintain balance in your life and is beneficial for your mental health. Programming can just be your job. This isn't some magical line of business.

## Conclusion

So, is it necessary to work on your hobby projects in order to get a job as a developer? Absolutely not. If you're a junior or have very little experience in the field you're applying to, it will probably help (a lot). But other skills are also vital in this job. Do what feels best for you and try forgetting about those stereotypes. Who wants to fit them anyway?
