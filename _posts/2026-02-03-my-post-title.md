Let's be honest. Those who have embraced AI as part of their daily development work have noticed significant improvements in both speed and quality. So the question is no longer "Is AI useful for coding?" but rather "How do I get the most out of it?"

Why do some developers see tremendous benefits while others end up with spaghetti code? I took on a challenge at the end of last year to only work by prompting, in order to learn the ins and outs of AI-assisted development. At my current level, I haven't written a single line of code by hand in a couple of months, yet my speed and quality have only improved.

In this blog post, I'll share my personal learnings from this journey and try to extract the most important takeaways in this Prompt Engineering 101 starter guide.

## So What's the Problem?

Most of us (myself included) first encountered AI capabilities through ChatGPT. For a long time, it served as a "Google replacement" and felt like a knowledgeable colleague you could ask for help and ideas. However, I quickly noticed AI's limitations, as I often received hallucinations and outdated information in return. Then came agents and code generation, where the impact of hallucinations and poor code quality actually became a hindrance rather than a benefit.

The workflow typically went something like this:
1. There's a bug to fix
2. You debug manually and try to find the root cause
3. You exhaust all your own resources trying to solve it
4. You finally ask the AI

The result is predictably poor and useless.

When I set the prompting challenge for myself, I quickly realized that using AI effectively requires a mental shift away from thinking of it as an "all-knowing entity." Instead, you need to guide the AI like you would instruct a junior developer, or once you are skilled enough in prompting, a peer at the same level. Once I started giving the agent simpler tasks, I found it performed remarkably well!

This is the most important lesson in prompt engineering: If you don't know how something should be done, the AI doesn't know either. AI is an eager guessing machine, and without clear guidance, it will simply guess, eagerly.

Se pää juttu koko hommassa on tekoälyn contextin ymmärtäminen.
