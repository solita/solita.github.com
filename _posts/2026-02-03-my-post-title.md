Let's be honest. Those who have embraced AI as part of their daily development work have noticed significant improvements in both speed and quality. So the question is no longer "Is AI useful for coding?" but rather "How do I get the most out of it?"

Why do some developers see tremendous benefits while others end up with spaghetti code? I took on a challenge at the end of last year to only work by prompting, in order to learn the ins and outs of AI-assisted development. At my current level, I haven't written a single line of code by hand in a couple of months, yet my speed and quality have only improved.

In this blog post, I'll share my personal learnings from this journey and try to extract the most important takeaways in this Prompt Engineering 101 starter guide.
