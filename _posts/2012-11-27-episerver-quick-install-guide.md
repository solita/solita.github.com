This is a short guide for installing EPiServer 7 on a cloud server. If you have any problems, please feel free to ask questions at the bottom of the page!

The goal is to get EPiServer 7 up and running on a Windows 2008 cloud server. The URL of your server will be http://yourownaccount.no-ip.org. What you need to do is:

1. Get a free domain name from [No-IP.com](http://www.no-ip.com/).
2. Get a free Windows 2008 cloud server from [Upcloud](http://fi.upcloud.com/).
3. Configure your server and install the prerequisites.
4. Install EPiServer on the cloud server.
5. Browse to http://yourownaccount.no-ip.org.


### Step 1: Get a free domain name from No-IP.com ###
1. Register at [No-IP](http://www.no-ip.com/).
2. Create a new Host by clicking *Add Host*.

3. Use the default values for the IP address and the other fields, and click *Save*.

### Step 2: Create a cloud server at Upcloud ###

1. Register at [Upcloud](http://fi.upcloud.com/rekisteroidy).
2. Log in and create a new virtual Windows server (choose Windows Server 2008 R2 as the image).

3. Enter yourownaccount.no-ip.org as the FQDN name.
4. Click *Create* and wait until your virtual cloud server is ready. Choose the *Send password to email* option.
5. Link the domain name to the cloud server: Copy the IP address of your server (e.g. 80.69.174.99) onto the clipboard. Paste the IP address to your host settings at [No-IP](http://www.no-ip.com/).
6. Wait a minute or two while the DNS records are being updated.

### Step 3: Configure your server and install the prerequisites ###

1. Log in to the server at yourownaccount.no-ip.org with RDP: Start a *Remote Desktop Connection* from the Start menu (Mac users, start CORD) and enter yourownaccount.no-ip.org as the host name. Use the user name *Administrator* and the password sent to you by email.
2. Now you should see the desktop of your server:
![virtual-server](/img/episerver/virtual-server.png)
3. Create a new user called *episerver* with administrator privileges: go to *Control panel* &rarr; *Add or remove user accounts* &rarr; *Create a new account* (choose *Administrator* as the account type).
4. Log out and log in again, now as the user *episerver*.
5. Install the .NET Framework 4: [Download the installer](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851) to your desktop computer.
6. Copy the file onto the clipboard.
7. Paste the file onto the virtual server's desktop:<br/>

8. Install the .NET Framework by double clicking the installer on the server.
9. Install ASP.NET MVC 4: [Download the installer](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc4) to your desktop computer. Then copy & paste the file to the virtual server, and run the installer by double clicking the file.

### Step 4: Install EPiServer on the cloud server ###

1. Install EPiServer 7: [Download the installer](http://world.episerver.com/Download/Items/EPiServer-CMS/EPiServer-7---CMS/), copy it to the virtual server, and run it there.
2. When the installation is finished, start the *Deployment center*.
3. Choose the option *Install site and SQL Server database*
4. Use the default values for everything except the port (80) and the UI URL (/cms/ui). By using the port 80 your server will be available at the URL http://yourownaccount.no-ip.org
![epi-config](/img/episerver/epi-config.png)
5. You need to start your newly created application: Go to the *IIS Manager* (*Start* &rarr; *Run*, type *IIS* and choose *IIS Manager*), and stop the default site by choosing *Stop*. Then start the EPiServer site by selecting it and clicking *Start*.
