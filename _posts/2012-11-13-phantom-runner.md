**tldr;** PhantomRunner is a Java based testing library which provides integration between JUnit and Jasmine via PhantomJS headless browser and it is hosted at [https://github.com/solita/phantom-runner](https://github.com/solita/phantom-runner)

# The pain of Javascript #
Most of us who are in the business of writing software to the Web are more or less familiar with Javascript - the "assembly" of the web. Although writing Javascript isn't nearly as painful as writing raw assembly it can get quite tedious due to several unexpected properties it has.

However most of the problems of Javascript can be bypassed and they don't cause too big a problem when you are aware of them. But there is still one huge workflow issue considering Javascript: testing. Currently the way we test Javascript code is either by not doing it at all (the most common case) or via system level testing by using something like [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/). System level testing is fine and very much needed but due to the rise of Single Page Applications we have real need for unit testing the business logic of Javascript code too. For this we should use one of the available unit testing libraries for Javascript.

Obviously both system level and unit level testing is required these days where Javascript code bases get bigger and bigger. In fact, with Javascript it is **even more important** due to the language's quirky behavior. There is no real type mechanism, there are no imports and so on. Good unit tests can remove a lot of pain from developing Javascript code.

But those who like to develop their program code test-first are facing a dilemma: all of the testing libraries available expect you to run your tests in a browser. This is a reasonable requirement since browsers have the most up to date Javascript interpreters and if you are writing code with Javascript you are more than likely to run it in browser too where you have stuff like DOM available. But really, who wants to continuously switch between your programming environment and a browser when you are developing software test-first? You want to be able to run tests **all** the time without context switches.

## jsTestDriver ##
Fortunately there is a solution (or two actually) available to bypass this problem. [JsTestDriver](http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/) is a test execution framework which allows you to keep your browser in a background while executing tests from command line or from your IDE. It does this by starting a HTTP server which provides a special page for the browsers which binds them to jsTestDriver and readies them to receive tests to be executed.

The instant benefit of this is that your tests can be executed blindingly fast - so fast in fact that the default in jsTestDriver's Eclipse plugin is to run your tests all the time after each save. Even largish test sets can be ran in milliseconds (yes, milliseconds, not seconds). Another benefit is that you can bind multiple browsers at the same time and jsTestDriver can send the tests to each of these concurrently thus allowing one to ensure that all browsers execute your code properly.

There are problems though. First of these is that the jsTestDriver IDE plugins are really buggy. Even if the command line software works fine the IDE integration does not. It isn't really a much better to switch between your IDE and command line than to switch between your IDE and a browser to execute your tests. Sure, with jsTestDriver you can execute your tests with multiple browsers at once which is indeed a big bonus. But still with a lacking support for IDEs the jsTestDriver just doesn't quite get there.

Another problem with jsTestDriver is that it forces you to write your tests in jsTestDriver's own format. It does not provide any kind of abstraction over existing testing libraries and thus if you've already written a huge amount of tests with for example [Jasmine](http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/) then you're out of luck.

A third problem is the fact that since it is it's own test runner executable the integration with continuous integration systems can get a bit tedious. It can be done, sure, but expect quite a bit of work until you get there.

Despite it's problems jsTestDriver is a really good idea and if it is developed further it might be the ultimate tool for interactive Javascript testing. But right now it's just a nice concept.

## PhantomRunner ##
After trying to integrate jsTestDriver into a Javascript intensive project I got really frustrated. Such a great tool but not quite there. This gave me an idea to create my own version of jsTestDriver which would bypass the main problems it has.

First of all, I decided that I want my test runner to be tightly integrated with [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/). This causes a dependency to Java but it also removes a whole bunch of problems. Due to the JUnit integration I can run my tests anywhere which can run JUnit based tests. This means a **huge** amount of different tools: continuous integration servers, build tools, IDEs and so on. I don't have to worry about writing IDE specific plugins - just let the existing JUnit integrations to do the work for me.

Second, I realized that I will not be able to create a perfect testing framework which would be better in any way compared to the existing frameworks. Thus I wanted the architecture to be flexible enough to support any testing framework provided that a support is written for it.

Third, I wanted the architecture to allow different server implementations. This would allow me to run my tests just once without pre-starting the server which would be great for CI environments or I could start a server once and keep on pounding tests at it thus providing me with a good test execution speed.

And last, I wanted to do all of this by using the [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) headless browser.

### Where are we currently? ###
The very first implementation of PhantomRunner is located at [Github](https://github.com/solita/phantom-runner). It is currently usable and can execute [Jasmine](http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/) based tests. It requires the latest PhantomJs browser to function and it does not support the prestarting of a server. But it does provide two different server implementations for different use case scenarios as a proof of concept that it can be done.

Already in it's current form PhantomRunner is ready to be used. Right now it requires you to compile it yourself (it's built with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)) and you need to write a single JUnit test class to bind it to JUnit. Below is an example of how this is done (it's actually the test class used in developing the PhantomJS and can be found from Github):

{% highlight java %}
@RunWith(PhantomRunner.class)
@PhantomConfiguration(
		phantomPath="phantomjs", 
		tests="**/*-test.js",
		injectLibs="classpath:require.js",
		interpreter=@JavascriptTestInterpreterConfiguration(
				interpreterClass=JasmineTestInterpreter.class,
				libraryFilePaths="classpath:jasmine/jasmine.js"
		))
public class PhantomRunnerTest {

}
{% endhighlight %}

PhantomRunner supports adding arbitrary libraries which will be loaded before the tests are ran which allows you to write tests which rely on the existence of those libraries. For example you might want to use [RequireJs](http://requirejs.org/) to handle your module loading. This allows you to test code reliably in such a way that all of it's dependencies are loaded too:

{% highlight javascript %}
// This is a completely valid way to do things with PhantomRunner
// and Require.js
require(["some/module"], function(module) {
	describe("Some module suite", function() {
		it("tests stuff", function() {
			expect(module.someMethod()).toBe("foo");
		});
	});
});
{% endhighlight}

In addition to easy integration to other testing frameworks PhantomRunner supports multiple server implementations to be used for communication between PhantomRunner and PhantomJs browser.

### What should still be done? ###
Current implementation of PhantomRunner is built purely for writing unit tests for your Javascript code. That does not mean however that it couldn't be expanded to support the more conventional integration testing needs. This would require a new server implementation which allows the PhantomJS to fetch the "test" HTML page from an actual server running your software and executing tests against it. This is the most requested feature for PhantomRunner inside Solita so it will be the first big new feature to appear into PhantomRunner.

Also currently PhantomRunner supports only Javascript based tests. It should be pretty easy to add support for CoffeeScript too which is used more and more everywhere these days. And finally the third big new feature would be to add a server implementation which would allow binding any browser (not just PhantomJS) to PhantomRunner, although this is still being evaluated if PhantomRunner should even try to do something like this.
